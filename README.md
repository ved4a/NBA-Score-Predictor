# NBA-Score-Predictor

This is my final project for the course 'Introduction to Machine Learning' taught by Prof. Sandeep Juneja in Monsoon 2024.

## Objective

Given a list of All-Star NBA players from the past 4 years, the user can select 2 teams of 5 players of their choosing. This project then aims to predict the final score based on player-aggregated data.
